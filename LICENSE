You can use twibble for free. The software comes “as is,” without any warranty. However, your carrier will charge you the network traffic and or text messages (SMS) twibble generates. Make sure you have a reasonable data or text plan. Otherwise it can get expensive! Also note that your position you are sending may be seen by anybody in the world e.g. in twittervision or twitter, via the twibble API, or other systems.  
The twibble clients send the requests to the twibble server at api.twibble.de which will forward the request to twitter.com and/or twitpic.com. Your twitter password will not be stored at the twibble server. Note, even if you are using SSL in you client the request to twitpic will always be unencrypted.
